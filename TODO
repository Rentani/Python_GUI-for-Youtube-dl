Youtube-dl GUI: 
       CURRENTLY WORKING ON:
              ☐ Better way of dealing with Elements. I don't want to rebuild the list everytime.

       IMPLEMENT:
              ☐ Allow CTRL+A in input box
              ☐ Directory options.
              ☐ Error Checks (Although not expecting any).
              ☐ Make the list section (where the visual elements are stored) scrollable.
              
       FIX:
                     
       CHANGE:
              ☐ Rework UI. Maybe create a mock up first.
              

       COMPLETED:
              ✔ Speed up info grabbing @done(19-12-09 16:28) 
              Done due to the real issue being the rebuilding of the list each time. 0.6s for link grabbing is fine.
              Best way to speed this up would be to use the youtube API
                     Opening image from URL is slower than caching the image.
                     Caching takes up space though and is possibly uneeded.
                     This is only true if the thumbnail was already downloaded though.

                     Image Grabbing
                     URLLIB3 IS TOO SLOW >2s
                     wget ~
                            Link1 ~ 0.14s
                            Link2 ~ 0.13s
                     Requests + BytesIO ~
                            Link1 ~ 0.14s
                            Link2 ~ 0.13s
                     Cached ~
                            Link1 ~ 0.16s
                            ~ 0.00s
                            Link2 ~ 0.16s
                            ~ 0.00s
                     Cached is best option as it's barely slower but far quicker if they use the same video again


                     Title Scrape
                     default ~ 
                            Link1 ~ 0.67s
                            Link2 ~ 0.65s
                     This is far too long just to get a title of a video.
                     Longest part is ~ self.title = BeautifulSoup( requests.get(self.url).text, 'html.parser' ) at 0.6s
                                   ~ of this, the 'requests.get(self.url).text' takes 0.57s
                                   ~ the parsing and extracting takes 0.07s
                     
                     urllib.request.urlopen().read() ~
                            Not even viable. It causes the rest of the stuff to take longer whilst still being 0.6s
                     urllib.request.urlopen() ~
                            Link1 ~ 0.17s
                            BUT OVERALL NOW TAKES 1.89s
                            NOT VIABLE
                     pytube ~
                            >1.5s
                            NOT VIABLE
                     Using default and the title of the webpage ~
                            Link1 ~ 0.6s
                            Link2 ~ 0.65s
                            This is barely faster but not as precise.
                     Mechanize ~
                            Link1 ~ 0.83s
                            NOT VIABLE
                     Using default and manually going through the webpage for the title ~
                            Link1 ~ 0.59s
                            Link2 ~ 0.575s
                     CURRENT BEST IS DEFAULT + MANUAL TRIMMING

       CANCELED:
       ✘ Working logger object. @cancelled(19-12-09 13:13)
              adding in the logger has made the program lock up again
              this could be because youtube-dl runs the logger in a loop waiting for inputs
              maybe create a thread, pre-create logger on thread, delete thread when finished
       
       
       ✘ Check if it's faster to use youtube-dl to get the info rather than 2 seperate downloads. @cancelled(19-12-09 13:13)
              Added perf counter
              It is far slower. <2s vs >0.75s
