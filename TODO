Youtube-dl GUI: 
       CURRENTLY WORKING ON:
              ☐ Auto scroll console output

       IMPLEMENT:
              ☐ Allow CTRL+A and ENTER in input box
              ☐ Directory options.
              ☐ Error Checks (Although not expecting any).
              ☐ Make the list section (where the visual elements are stored) scrollable.

       FIX:
              

       CHANGE:
              ☐ Rework UI. Maybe create a mock up first.
              

       COMPLETED:
              ✔ Speed up info grabbing @done(19-12-09 16:28) 
                     From 0.6 - 0.7 down to 0.27 - 0.35.
                     Instead of downloading a youtube page, it's now downloading a small embed page which only really contains the title. This cut 0.25-0.3s
                     Instead of downloading a high res imaged, now downloading a smaller image which cuts 1/4 of the time. 0.16s to 0.12s
              ✔ Better way of dealing with Elements. @done(19-12-09 22:14)
                     Info is now stored seperately so it no longer redownloads the thumbnail etc everytime the list is rebuilt.
                     The list now only deletes the tkinter widgets and recreates them and inputs the information via the InfoContainer
              ✔ Download no longer seems threaded. @done(19-12-09 22:29)
                     Fixed a typo. Ended up calling the function instead of sending it to the threadhandler.
