Youtube-dl GUI: 
       CURRENTLY WORKING ON:
              ☐ Make the list section (where the visual elements are stored) scrollable. 
       Notes:
              Scrolling frames aren't a thing.
              Solutions ~
                     Use a canvas and use Create_Window
                     Create a custom scroll by manipulating the x of all object in the list
                            This would actually require recreating the list everytime as you change the x of items.


       
       IMPLEMENT:
              ☐ Add support for playlist
              ☐ Directory options.
              ☐ Error Checks (Although not expecting any).
              ☐ Remove performance tools. Remove Time import.
              

       FIX:
              

       CHANGE:
              ☐ Mock up UI using Figma.
              ☐ Rework UI.
              

       COMPLETED:
              ✔ Speed up info grabbing @done(19-12-09 16:28) 
                     From 0.65s down to 0.32s. (Average)
                     Instead of downloading a youtube page, it's now downloading a small embed page which only really contains the title. This cut 0.25-0.3s
                     Instead of downloading a high res imaged, now downloading a smaller image which cuts 1/4 of the time. 0.16s to 0.12s
              ✔ Better way of dealing with Elements. @done(19-12-09 22:14)
                     Info is now stored seperately so it no longer redownloads the thumbnail etc everytime the list is rebuilt.
                     The list now only deletes the tkinter widgets and recreates them and inputs the information via the InfoContainer
              ✔ Download no longer seems threaded. @done(19-12-09 22:29)
                     Fixed a typo. Ended up calling the function instead of sending it to the threadhandler.
              ✔ Auto scroll console output @done(19-12-09 22:50)
                     Simple addition. Changed the yview to the bottom each time the console has an entry.
              ✔ Allow CTRL+A and ENTER in input box @done(19-12-10 00:54)
                     Fairly simple. Added some binds to the input Entry after creation.
