# GUI for Youtube-dl

Basic windows based GUI for Youtube-dl as a first project using Python.
Currently there is no support for playlists but that will be implemented later on.

Currently it's able to add multiple videos to a list and then download them all as either a video or mp3.

_REQUIRES_ both Youtube-dl and FFMPEG to be install. They also need to be added to the system path.
